                Niagara Falls is Canada's most famous natural attraction, bringing in millions of visitors each year. Located just over
                an hour's drive from Toronto, along the American border, these massive falls drop approximately 57 meters. You can see
                the falls at an astoundingly close distance from several key points.
                
                Niagara Falls and the Niagara Gorge have been attracting tourists and daredevils for well over a century. Between the
                mid-19th and mid-20th centuries there were numerous attempts to plunge over the falls in various types of homemade boats
                and barrels. This, along with tightrope walkers and other spectacles, led to the adjacent town of Niagara Falls
                developing a carnival type atmosphere that still persists today.
                
                Families will enjoy a walk down Niagara's outrageous Clifton Hill leading to the gorge and falls. Other popular things
                to do here include a cruise to the base of the falls, a trip up the Skylon Tower for a fantastic aerial view, and a look
                from the bottom of the falls on the Journey Behind the Falls experience.

                    On the shores of Lake Ontario in Canada's biggest city is the iconic CN Tower, one of Canada's most famous landmarks.
                    The tower stands an impressive 553 meters high and dominates the skyline.
                    
                    At the top, you can find fine dining in the revolving 360 restaurant, and enjoy a meal while looking out over the city
                    and lake. The LookOut and the Glass Floor offer beautiful views out over the entire area. For an added thrill, consider
                    stepping outside of the enclosed area onto the metal walkway for the CN Tower Edgewalk. You'll be harnessed in and then
                    be able to walk around the building, 116 stories or 356 meters (1,168 feet) above the ground below.
                    
                    But even those who choose not to go up the tower will find themselves stopping to stare at the structure, which is
                    visible from almost everywhere in the city. At night, the tower is lit in different colors.

                    Just a two-hour drive from Vancouver is the famous ski resort of Whistler Blackcomb and the year-round resort
                    destination of Whistler. While Whistler has always been an important winter sports area, it has also developed into a
                    popular summer destination, with golf, mountain biking, and a lively town atmosphere no matter when you visit.
                    
                    The village gained international attention in 2010 when it became one of the locations for the 2010 Winter Olympic
                    Games. The area offers world class skiing, hotels, and dining, as well as a variety of outdoor recreational
                    opportunities and beautiful mountain scenery.

                    Banff National Park lies in the heart of the majestic Rocky Mountains in the province of Alberta, and showcases some of
                    Canada's most beautiful scenery. Turquoise-colored lakes, snowcapped peaks, and glaciers are all easily accessible in
                    this stunning park. Take a scenic drive or head off on one of the best hikes in Banff.
                    
                    The jewel of the park is Lake Louise, where green waters reflect the surrounding mountains and glaciers, and visitors
                    can stroll easily around the shores. Just a short distance is Moraine Lake, another impressive alpine lake with an even
                    slightly more dramatic surrounding.

                    Old Montreal, lined with lovely historic buildings, is a place to go for great shopping and fine dining. While Montreal
                    itself is a vibrant modern city, Old Montreal, down by the waterfront, is where you'll want to go to soak up the
                    atmosphere.
                    
                    Some of the must-see places in Old Montreal include Rue Bonsecours and the landmark March√© Bonsecours in the old town

                    The Bay of Fundy, located in Eastern Canada in between New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, is known for its amazing tides.
                    The variation between high and low is the largest in the world, measuring up to a maximum of 19 meters (10 fathoms).
                    
                    While there are many ways to appreciate this natural wonder, some of the most popular locations and sights along the Bay

                    Although it is less than a two-hour ferry ride from the mainland, Vancouver Island can seem a world away. Most people
                    head to Victoria, BC's capital city, for sightseeing and culture, but if you head north into the wild and remote
                    landscapes, the island holds some unexpected and unforgettable experiences.
                    
                    Nature lovers can hit the best hiking trails on Vancouver Island and set themselves up at some beautiful camping
                    locations. Those looking for more comfort can always turn to one of the island's lodges or resorts.
                    
                    One of the island's most incredible sights are the old-growth forests of giant trees, some more than 1,000 years old.
                    Within day-tripping distance of Victoria are the ancient trees of Eden Grove, near the town of Port Renfrew. If you are
                    heading up island, you can also wander through Cathedral Grove, not far from the town of Port Alberni, or go all the way
                    out to Tofino to see even more huge trees.

                    At the entrance to St. John's harbor, overlooking the city and sea, is Signal Hill National Historic Site. It was here,
                    in 1901, that the first wireless transatlantic signal was received. It also played a strategic role in the Seven Years
                    war with France, although the current fortifications were built during the hostilities of 1812.
                    
                    The Cabot Tower is one of the key sites of Signal Hill. It was built in 1897 to mark the four hundredth anniversary of
                    the discovery of Newfoundland. It also now commemorates Guglielmo Marconi's reception here in 1901 of the first
                    transatlantic radio telegraphy signal, transmitted over a distance of 2,700 kilometers from Poldhu in England.
                    
                    In the tower are exhibitions on the history of Signal Hill and the history of communications (with a special section on
                    Marconi). From the top, you can enjoy panoramic views of the city and the coast as far as Cape Spear ‚Äì the most easterly
                    point of North America.
